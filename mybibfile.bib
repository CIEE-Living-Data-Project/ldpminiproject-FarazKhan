abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a key component of fate and transport models for most metals, including mercury (Hg). Utilizing a suite of diverse DOM isolates, we demonstrated that DOM character, in addition to concentration, influences inorganic Hg (Hg(II)i) bioavailability to Hg-methylating bacteria. Using a model Hg-methylating bacterium, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132, we evaluated Hg-DOM-sulfide bioavailability in washed-cell assays at environmentally relevant Hg/DOM ratios (∼1-8 ng Hg/mg C) and sulfide concentrations (1-1000 $\mu$M). All tested DOM isolates significantly enhanced Hg methylation above DOM-free controls (from ∼2 to >20-fold for 20 mg C/L DOM solutions), but high molecular weight/highly aromatic DOM isolates and/or those with high sulfur content were particularly effective at enhancing Hg methylation. Because these experiments were conducted under conditions of predicted supersaturation with respect to metacinnabar ($\beta$-HgS(s)), we attribute the DOM-dependent enhancement of Hg(II)i bioavailability to steric and specific chemical (e.g., DOM thiols) inhibition of $\beta$-HgS(s) growth and aggregation by DOM. Experiments examining the role of DOM across a wide sulfide gradient revealed that DOM only enhances Hg methylation under fairly low sulfide conditions (30 $\mu$M), conditions that favor HgS nanoparticle/cluster formation relative to dissolved HgS species. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) includes an array of carbon-based compounds that vary in size and structure and have complex interactions with mercury (Hg) cycling in aquatic systems. While many studies have examined the relationship between dissolved organic carbon concentrations ([DOC]) and methyl Hg bioaccumulation, few studies have considered the effects of DOM composition (e.g., protein-content, aromaticity). The goal of this study was to explore the relationships between total and methyl [Hg] in water, invertebrates, and fish and optically derived measures of DOM composition from 47 lake and river sites across a boreal watershed. Results showed higher aqueous total [Hg] in systems with more aromatic DOM and higher [DOC], potentially due to enhanced transport from upstream or riparian areas. Methyl [Hg] in biota were all positively related to the amount of microbial-based DOM and, in some cases, to the proportions of labile and protein-like DOM. These results suggest that increased Hg bioaccumulation is related to the availability of labile DOM, potentially due to enhanced Hg methylation. DOM composition explained 68% and 54% more variability in [Hg] in surface waters and large-bodied fish, respectively, than [DOC] alone. These results show that optical measures of DOM characteristics are a valuable tool for understanding DOM-Hg biogeochemistry.},

abstract = {The semiarid prairie pothole region of the North American Great Plains is characterized by millions of small, shallow, closed basin wetlands. These wetlands are hydrologically dynamic, often losing considerable water volume and depth seasonally in response to high evaporative stress and/or infiltration rates. However, the consequences of such water loss on wetland water chemistry parameters, in particular dissolved organic carbon (DOC), remain relatively unstudied. Seasonal changes in DOC concentrations in 12 freshwater and saline wetlands at the St. Denis National Wildlife Refuge near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, were examined over an 8-year period (1993?2000). Specific conductivity in the study ponds ranged from 312 ?S cm?1 to 33,493 ?S cm?1 (seasonal means). DOC concentrations in all study ponds were high (>10 mg L?1) and increased across a gradient of increasing salinity (mean DOC values from fresh water to saline ranged from 19.7 mg L?1 to 102.7 mg L?1). In the majority of ponds, DOC concentrations increased seasonally from spring through fall. On average this increase was 21 mg L?1, with fall values averaging 60% greater than spring. The greatest DOC increases were observed in saline ponds which lost most of their water by evaporation. Although DOC in these ponds was highly correlated with the conservative tracer, chloride, the slopes of these regression lines were always less than 1 as were the DOC:chloride ratios, indicating nonconservative DOC behavior. Additionally, chloride concentrations increased much faster seasonally than did DOC. Taken together, these data indicated that although DOC was not behaving conservatively, at least some of the observed DOC increases could be explained by simple evapoconcentration. These data also suggested that saline ponds appeared to experience net seasonal removal of DOC. Possible removal mechanisms for DOC include infiltration to the pond margin, bacterial utilization, and photolysis. Freshwater ponds, which lost most of their water by infiltration to the pond margin, on the other hand, displayed less seasonal variation in DOC concentrations. In these ponds, the relationship between DOC and chloride ion was not as strong as in the saline ponds; the slope of this relationship was always >1, as were DOC:chloride ratios. These data indicated that although DOC was being lost to the pond margin as water infiltrated, freshwater ponds accumulated DOC seasonally. Decomposition and excretion of DOC by macrophytes, as well as by pelagic and attached phytoplankton, are the likely within pond sources of DOC here. The rapid response of these small, shallow aquatic systems to water loss make them ideal microcosms in which to study effects of climate on DOC concentrations and other water chemistry parameters.},

abstract = {The molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is increasingly recognized as fundamentally important to mercury transport and transformations, with numerous approaches undertaken to examine DOM characteristics beyond dissolved organic carbon concentrations. In this study, we use a high-resolution mass spectrometry approach, Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, to characterize DOM compound classes, DOM aromaticity (AImod), and the nominal oxygenation state of carbon (NOSC) across thirteen small boreal forest streams in central Canada. We then relate the relative abundance of hundreds of different DOM molecules with inorganic mercury and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations across late spring and fall seasons. The number of significant correlations and the classes of DOM compounds significantly correlating with inorganic mercury and MeHg concentrations differs substantially across seasons and between mercury forms. For inorganic mercury, the abundance of nitrogen and sulfur containing DOM are most often positively correlated (mean $\rho$ = 0.80) in the late spring, whereas during the fall, the abundance of low-oxidized lignins is more important, though with weaker correlations (mean $\rho$ = 0.51). For MeHg, low-oxidized lignins and hydrolysable tannins, likely sourced from conifer throughfall and litter, account for up to 83% of all DOM-MeHg correlations regardless of season. Further network analyses reveal that the strongest and most significant inorganic mercury-DOM correlations are found across a wide range of NOSC values, indicating that DOM involved with the transport of inorganic mercury encompasses a wide range of polarities and thermodynamic stabilities. In contrast, DOM molecules exclusively correlated with MeHg concentrations have more positive NOSC and AImod values, implying the preferential transport of MeHg with more thermodynamically stable and aromatic DOM molecules. DOM molecules significantly correlated with both inorganic mercury and MeHg concentrations are found exclusively in the late spring. Overall, this non-targeted approach may help to inform further targeted investigations, especially as it relates to the underrepresented importance of plant biomolecules in facilitating mercury transport.

abstract = {Stormwater management ponds and created habitat wetlands effectively manage erosion, flooding, and pollutant loadings while providing biodiversity and aesthetic benefits, but these structures are also potential sources of methylmercury (MeHg), a bioaccumulative neurotoxin. While MeHg accumulation has been confirmed in habitat wetlands, the extent of MeHg production and accumulation in stormwater ponds is unknown. Additionally, the fine-scale spatial variation in MeHg in these wetlands has never been explored despite the possibility that cycles of wetting and drying, and the presence of aquatic plants may stimulate methylation at their margins. To address these knowledge gaps, we compared MeHg and inorganic mercury concentrations, the percent of total mercury present as MeHg (%MeHg), and potential mercury methylation rate constants (Kmeth) in the sediments of terrestrial-aquatic transects through several stormwater and habitat wetlands. We present novel evidence confirming the in situ production of MeHg in both stormwater ponds and habitat wetlands, but observe no systematic differences across the terrestrial-aquatic gradient, suggesting that routine variations in water level do not alter MeHg production and accumulation. Stormwater ponds effectively trap mercury while converting relatively little to MeHg, as evidenced by lower MeHg concentrations, %-MeHg, and Kmethvalues than habitat wetlands, but often greater inorganic Hg concentrations. The relationship of aquatic vegetation to MeHg accumulation is weak and ambiguous, suggesting plants are not strong drivers of MeHg biogeochemistry in these systems. Although the MeHg hazard associated with individual artificial wetlands is low, they may be important sources of MeHg at the landscape level.},
